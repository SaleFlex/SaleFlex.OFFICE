import enum


class EventName(enum.Enum):
    """
    Enum representing different event names and custom function names used in the system.
    
    Event names are used to define the behavior of controls (buttons, textboxes, etc.) in forms.
    These events are typically assigned to controls via the form_control_function1 field in the database.
    
    Relationship with ControlName:
    -----------------------------
    Event names work together with ControlName enums to create a complete control behavior system.
    A control's name (ControlName) identifies what it is, and the event (EventName) defines what it does.
    
    Common Pairings:
    ---------------
    - ControlName.LOGIN + EventName.LOGIN or EventName.LOGIN_EXTENDED
    - ControlName.LOGOUT + EventName.LOGOUT
    - ControlName.EXIT + EventName.EXIT_APPLICATION
    - ControlName.CASHIER_NAME + EventName.LOGIN or EventName.SAVE_CHANGES
    - ControlName.CASHIER_NAME_LIST + EventName.LOGIN or EventName.SAVE_CHANGES
    - ControlName.PASSWORD + EventName.LOGIN or EventName.SAVE_CHANGES
    - ControlName.BARCODE_LENGTH + EventName.SAVE_CHANGES
    - ControlName.IMAGE_FOLDER + EventName.SAVE_CHANGES
    - ControlName.LICENSE_OWNER + EventName.NONE (display only)
    
    Event Categories:
    ----------------
    Application Lifecycle: EXIT_APPLICATION, LOGIN, LOGIN_EXTENDED, LOGOUT
    Sales Operations: SALE, SALE_DEPARTMENT, SALE_PLU_CODE, SALE_PLU_BARCODE, etc.
    Payment Operations: PAYMENT, CASH_PAYMENT, CREDIT_PAYMENT, CHECK_PAYMENT, etc.
    Document Operations: CANCEL_DOCUMENT, CHANGE_DOCUMENT_TYPE, TOTAL, SUBTOTAL
    Configuration: CONFIG, SAVE_CHANGES, SERVICE_* events
    Navigation: BACK, CLOSE_FORM, REDRAW_FORM, various *_MENU events
    Stock/Warehouse: STOCK_IN, STOCK_OUT, WAREHOUSE_RECEIPT, etc.
    Restaurant: TABLE_OPEN, TABLE_CLOSE, ORDER_ADD, CHECK_PRINT, etc.
    Market: SUSPEND_SALE, RESUME_SALE, SUSPEND_LIST
