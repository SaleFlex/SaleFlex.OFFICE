import enum


class FormName(enum.Enum):
    """
    Enum representing different names of forms used in the system.
    
    Form names are used throughout the application to identify specific forms.
    These names work together with ControlName and EventName enums to create
    a complete form and event handling system.
    
    Usage Examples:
    --------------
    - In application.py: Use FormName.LOGIN instead of 'LOGIN' string
    - In event handlers: Use FormName.SALE when navigating to sales form
    - In dynamic_renderer.py: Use FormName when looking up forms by name
    
    Form Categories:
    ---------------

        - LOGIN: Standard login form with username/password
        - LOGIN_EXT: Extended login with additional authentication
        - LOGIN_SERVICE: Service/maintenance personnel login
